# Robotic Speech
- "speech_v1" contains a simple example of voice recognition, and generic text to speech output. To use, download and run the file.
- "speech_v2" contains a complex example of vocal synthesis in place of the generic TTS seen in speech_v1. To use this version, the user must obtain the appropriate json file api-key from Google, and enable the TTS module through Google's website by entering a payment method. If done correctly, the user has the option to choose either the "standard" TTS or the "wavenet" TTS. Wavenet is better, but costs most ($16 per 1 million characters synthesized, billed monthly).
- "speech_v3" contains the first iteration of the ibm watson assistant integration. It is able to connect directly to an assistant in order to form a response. API key, assistant version date, assistant service url, assistant id, and session id are needed to make the connection work. Note that when new intents/dialog are added to the assistant online, they will become immidiately available through the api connection in the program (no delay time).
